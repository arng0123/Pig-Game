# Pig Game
Be the first player to get to reach 100 points in this game of Pig! 

Rules: 
- Neither die rolls a 1, sum of both die is added to the turn total and the player continues unless they "hold" 
- "Hold" will end the current player's turn and will add their current score to tehir total score
- If either die rolls a 1, no points are added to the player's total score
- If both dice roll 1 ("snake eyes"), the player's turn ends and their total score is back to 0
- If both dices values are equal, the current player must roll again without the option to hold
